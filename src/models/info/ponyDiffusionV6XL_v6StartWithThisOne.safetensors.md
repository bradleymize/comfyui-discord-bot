# Description
Pony Diffusion V6 is a versatile SDXL finetune capable of producing stunning SFW and NSFW visuals of various anthro, feral, or humanoids species and their interactions based on simple natural language prompts.

This model supports a wide array of styles and aesthetics but provides an opinionated default prompt template that allows generation of high quality samples with no negative prompt and otherwise default settings

`score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, score_5_up, score_4_up, just describe what you want, tag1, tag2`

Other special data selection tags include, `source_pony`, `source_furry`, `source_cartoon` and `source_anime` and ratings of `rating_safe`, `rating_questionable` and `rating_explicit`.

This model is capable of recognizing many popular and obscure characters and series

Using Euler a with 25 steps and resolution of 1024px is recommended although model generally can do most supported SDXL resolution.
